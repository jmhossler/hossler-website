# hossler-website

I am attempting to make a CI deployed website using flask, docker, kubernetes, and travis.

I've already deployed this website to jmhossler.net, but as you can see it is a very basic website.
Since I've never maintained a website/service that is deployed to kubernetes, I've decided to
try to do so with a simple personal application with the intent of gaining the experience
of automated service deployment for profressional use.

# Short-term Roadmap

- [x] Automatically deploy changes pushed to master to jmhossler.net when all tests pass
- [ ] Publish coverage reports for tests
- [ ] Create basic personal web page, including experience, hobbies, and projects
- [ ] Document architecture and things learned during creation of website on website
